# Personal Blog

A simple personal blogsite, powered by Github pages and Jekyll.

I plan to write about my random researches and devlogs on an infrequent basis.

### Post Categorization:

Categories are mutually exclusive tags for a post - Each post will be mapped to 1 and only 1 category.
Whereas posts can have zero or many tags (I plan to replace tags with *keywords* instead, which will somehow need to be automatically generated...)

Here are the six categories of blog posts, roughly and extension from [this "Grand Unified Theory" of Documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)

Category | Category tag | Description
---------|--------------|------------
Tutorial | `tutorial` | Blog posts designed to teach a specific skill or process step-by-step. The tutorial post will focus more on providing a short and concise list of things to do.
How-To Guides | `how-to` | Practical instructions on how to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular goal. The how-to guide will focus more on fully understanding how to complete a task.
Explanation | `explanation` | Posts that dives into the "whys" behind concepts, technologies, or design choices.
Reference | `reference` | Factual, technical information about specific tools, concepts, APIs, or code snippets; like an API reference.
Devlogs | `devlog` | Posts detailing my journey on a project, including motivations, thought process, challenges, solutions, and lesson learned.
Miscellaneous | `misc` | Anything else that does not neatly fall into the above categories will be broadly grouped under this category.
